workflow for joint projects draws extensively from Hunt Allcott's lab wiki and the Gentzkow and Shapiro RA manual on GitHub. In some places we simply link to their manuals or even quote them directly. This workflow is closer to Hunt's in that it is stripped-down relative to the full Gentzkow and Shapiro workflow. The simpler workflow conveys the benefit of being accessible to a broader range of collaborators who cannot pay the fixed costs of using the full system. For example, we do not use SCons, as SCons requires additional coding and file maintenance that may not be necessary except on larger projects. An excellent overview of the Gentzkow-Shapiro RA manual is the PDF Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner's Guide. While outdated on some of the specifics (e.g., SVN vs GitHub), this overview is a worthwhile read on principles for managing code and data. \nThe workflow has three core principles:\n\nOne-stroke production. The entire project, from initial data to all final results, tables, and figures, can be run from one command, typically GitHub/ProjectName/MakePaper.sh. This means that all intermediate steps (e.g. importing and analyzing data, taking a csv output table and inserting into the paper, compiling the paper) are fully automated. This prevents us from, for example, changing a data prep routine but forgetting to update all the results.\nCoding for replication. At the end of the project, we will publicly post all code and data that we are legally able to post. \nUnambiguous processes. One the concept for the project has been decided on, any new collaborator should be able to jump in and continue where a previous person had left off. We keep task management (GitHub Issues) up-to-date. We have no half-finished or legacy files in the folders.\n\n"},"pages/Software-setup.html":{"url":"pages/Software-setup.html","title":"Software Setup","keywords":"","body":"Software setup\nBelow are links to installing and setting up the software we will commonly use (whether you are on a PC or a Mac), along with links to useful software manuals:\nSoftware installs\nGitHub\nWe use GitHub for task management and software version control. Send your GitHub username to the group member in charge of setting up the GitHub repository, so that you can be added.\nIf you have not used GitHub before, join GitHub and also either install GitHub desktop or install Git (Git for Windows here). You should also install git-lfs, which we will use to sync output files (typically pdfs) through GitHub.\nResources for learning git and GitHub workflow:\n\nPrimer on version control systems and command line Git\nConfiguring Git; Git shortcuts\nGitHub cheat sheet\n10-minute GitHub guide\nGitHub learning resources\nMastering markdown\ngit-lfs additional info, including GitHub desktop implementation.\n\nSlack\nWe use Slack for: (1) brief communications and questions that can be easily resolved without creating a formal GitHub issue; and (2) recording meeting notes. Download desktop and mobile apps for Slack.\n\nBeginner Slack guide\nWorking in Slack\nSlack Posts\n\nLatex\nWe write papers in latex. You will need a latex compiler from MikTex as well as a text editor that integrates with MikTex.

For storing intermediate work and personal files, you could set up a separate Dropbox folder called ProjectName-Personal.\nGitHub and Dropbox have different features, which determine which file types we store on them. GitHub cannot store large files, but it keeps complete version histories and makes it easy to roll back to previous versions. Dropbox can store large files, but it may keep incomplete version histories (depending on your Dropbox account) and makes it difficult to comprehensively roll back to previous versions. We thus store all code and final output files on GitHub, while we store large data files and various other project files (e.g., literature and notes), on Dropbox.\nGitHub repository\nThe GitHub repo has two main folders: Code and Paper. \n\n/Code/Build contains all data prep code.\n/Code/Analysis contains all code to construct tables and figures.\n/Paper/ contains the .tex and .bib files for the paper, and the compiled pdfs\n/Paper/Figures contains ONLY figures for use in the paper and presentations\nOther figures should go into a scratch or other output folder on dropbox\n\n\n/Paper/Tables contains ONLY tables for use in the paper and presentation\nOther tables should go into a scratch or other output folder on dropbox\n\n\n/Paper/Ppt contains Powerpoint slides, which is useful for creating cartoon figures and for creating full presentations (Ryan is old-school and does not like Beamer presentations).\n\nThe repo may also include a notes folder for plain text notes that we would like to be versioned.\nGitHub likes to keep total storage low, and will not allow users to push files larger than 100MB. If for some reason a code or output file is larger than about 10 MB, then we should store it on Dropbox.\nThere are two ways of storing something on GitHub: regularly within the repo and in git-lfs (download git-lfs and see additional info, including GitHub desktop implementation).\nThe following types of files are the only files that can be stored regularly in the GitHub repository:\n\nDiffable files (.txt, .csv, .R, .do, etc.) that are under 10 MB.\n\nThe following files can be stored in git-lfs:\n\nFiles that are not diffable (binaries, such as: .pdf, .dta, .rds, .ppt, etc.) but are under 10MB (or darn close...)\nDiffable files that are over 10 MB.\nAll non-diffable files should be added to the git-lfs tracking (e.g., git lfs track *.pdf). This will cause git to automatically place these files within git-lfs. Large diffable files should be added to lfs manually (e.g., git lfs track output/data/somebigfile.txt).\n\nDropbox\nDropbox stores all data files as well as other project documents.\n\ndropbox/ProjectName/RawData stores all original data files that are used in the analysis. (If there is a data file that we want to store for possible future use/reference but we are not using in the analysis, we should store it in a separate folder called dropbox/ProjectName/DataStorage/.) \nThe only manipulations that we will generally make within the /RawData folder are: (1) unzipping; and (2) importing into formats readable by Stata, R, etc. When such manipulations are necessary, we should use the following subfolder structure\n/RawData/orig contains the data as originally obtained. We perform no direct edits in this subfolder, not even unzipping.\n/RawData/data contains data from RawData/orig that have been unzipped and/or imported into a .dta, .Rdata, etc format. We usually do not make any further manipulations here (one exception: correcting double-entry conflicts).\n\n\nThe output from any further manipulations of data should go into dropbox/ProjectName/IntermediateData.\nAll folders containing raw data should have a plain text README file that details the data source and any additional information that is necessary for replication.\n\n\ndropbox/ProjectName/IntermediateData stores all intermediate data files, i.e. files created by the code in the GitHub Code folder.\n/Admin stores time sheets, data use agreements, etc.\n/Literature stores all relevant literature, typically in pdf format. Please use the following format to name files: Authors_ShortTitle_Year.pdf.\n/Notes stores any comments or notes that we want to share between each other that are too long or complicated for a post on slack (e.g. a latex file and associated pdf that works through a proof). Very long notes in plain text format (e.g., long latex proofs) could be done in a Notes folder within the Github repo.\n/Scratch stores figures, tables, and other output that we generate in the course of data exploration and are not intended to be used in the paper (see \"Exploratory Work\" further below)\n\nCode structure\nIn general, the code in GitHub/.../Code/Build/ will operate on data from dropbox/.../RawData/ and place it in dropbox/.../IntermediateData/. Then code in GitHub/.../Code/Analysis/ will take data from dropbox/.../IntermediateData/ and construct figures and tables to be placed in GitHub/.../Paper/Figures or /Tables. We also want to be able to trace dependencies and keep the folders clean of unused files. Thus, to the extent that is reasonable, GitHub/.../Code/Build, dropbox/.../RawData/, dropbox/.../IntermediateData/, and perhaps GitHub/.../Code/Analysis should have parallel structures. For example, these folders might all have a subfolder called \"CensusData\", so code from GitHub/.../Code/Build/CensusData/ prepares data from dropbox/.../RawData/CensusData/ and puts prepared data in dropbox/.../IntermediateData/CensusData/. \nLog files\nLog files can be useful tools for recording the most recent run of each script. If you set up your code to keep a log file, it should adhere to the following guidelines:\n\nLogs should always be plain text files (e.g. use , replace text in the Stata log command, and name the file with a .txt extension)\nName the log file the same as the script, but with \"_log.txt\" at the end. E.g., the file \"merge_data.do\" should create a log named \"merge_data_log.txt\"\nLog files are stored in GitHub. Each script writes the log file to a \"Logfiles\" subdirectory located in the same folder as the script.\n\nExploratory work\nEspecially early in a project, there will be exploratory work that may or may not go into the paper. This code for this work could live in git branches, with output going to /Scratch/ subfolders on Dropbox. For instance, we might generate initial descriptive statistics or diagnostics that inform our data wrangling but will not be included in the paper or appendices. Please keep this work clean: once we are fairly sure that an analysis is not in the paper, it should be removed from the master repo. We can always return to it if needed.\n"},"pages/Project-Outline.html":{"url":"pages/Project-Outline.html","title":"Project Outline","keywords":"","body":"Project Outline\nWe use outlines to add structure to projects. Each project has one outline. An outline encodes future plans that cannot currently be characterized by concrete tasks and records dependencies that are hard to encode in tasks. We normally store the outline in the GitHub wiki associated with the project's repository.\n"},"pages/GitHub-Issues.html":{"url":"pages/GitHub-Issues.html","title":"GitHub Issues","keywords":"","body":"GitHub Issues\nWe use GitHub for task management. Any quick question that would take less than one hour to answer can be done via Slack. Any task that will take more than one hour should be set up as an Issue in the GitHub repo. \nTask deliverables\n\nEach task should have a final deliverable summarizing the results.\nThe form of the deliverable may be:\nContent added to the draft, slides, or appendix\nA note in the /Notes directory\nA final summary comment in the task comment thread (e.g., for tasks involving modifications to data preparation code that do not directly yield paper content or for small tasks where the deliverable content is no more than a paragraph or so of text)\n\n\nThe deliverable should be self-contained. It should usually begin with a concise summary of the conclusions (e.g., an answer to an empirical question or a modification to the code), followed by supporting detail. A user should be able to learn all relevant results from a task from the deliverable without looking back at the comment thread or task description. The source of any figures, tables, or statistics should also be clear; this will be automatic for markdown files or checked in drafts, slides, etc. so long as figures and tables are produced from links to checked-in files in the repository.\nThe final comment at the time a task is closed should include a clear, revision-stable pointer to the deliverable -- usually a link along with additional information if needed (e.g., relevant page / table / figure numbers in the draft or line numbers in code).\n\nCreating a task\n\nAnyone can create a task\nIf Ryan/other more senior person asks you to do a task (via email or Slack or in a meeting), you are responsible for recording this in a GitHub Issue and assigning it to yourself. This should be your first step after the meeting so we don't lose track of tasks.\nThe assignee should create a separate git branch for each task that involves code or output stored in the repository. The new branch should be called issue###-brief_description, where ### corresponds with the issue number. Make sure you do not push your changes to master before the task is completed.\nAdditional branches can be made off of the main issue###-brief_description branch as needed. These sub-issue branches should be merged into the main issue###-brief_description branch, not into the master branch.\n\n\n\nComment threads in GitHub Issues\n\nYou should add regular comments to tasks summarizing progress. The comment threads are your real estate and you are free to include updates as often as you find useful. Preliminary output, \"notes to self,\" etc. are fine.\nIf you have a question that requires input from another lab member, you should write a comment, including an '@' reference, that makes clear exactly what input is needed. E.g., '@kelloggrk, Where would you like me to store the data files?' Users should keep email notifications for '@' references turned on.\nIt is up to you to judge the optimal time to request feedback. You should usually not send results until you have spent some time making sure they are correct and make sense. When you do request feedback, you should provide a clear and concise summary making clear the situation and exactly what input you need. At the same time, you should not feel shy about requesting feedback when you are confident it will be efficient and valuable.\nThe Issues pages are our primary documentation of decisions we are making as we move through the project. If you have an important interaction about a task outside of GitHub -- in person, over IM, etc. -- add a comment to briefly summarize the content of that interaction and the conclusions reached. The reason is that we don't want to have to search through meeting notes, emails, or Slack threads to understand how/why we made a decision 15 months ago.\nAny link in a comment to other files in the repo should link to the file at a specific commit (see here for details).\nAny link within an issue to another issue should be hyperlinked using the '#' reference. E.g., #123. \n\nCompleting a task\nWhen an assignee thinks a task is complete, he/she should:\n\nEnsure that the deliverable meets our standards as outlined above\nIf the deliverable involves commits to GitHub files:\nSubmit a pull request to merge the issue-specific branch into the master branch.\nPull requests should be titled as follows: \"Pull request for #[ORIGINAL ISSUE NO]: [ORIGINAL ISSUE TITLE]\"\nPull requests should hyperlink to the issue using the '#' reference. E.g., #123. \nYou are empowered to merge your own pull request once you are satisfied.\nSquash merges are typically preferred to merge the issue-specific branch into the master branch.\nDelete the issue###-brief_description branch  \n\n\nClose the original issue after adding a final comment that summarizes the deliverable and includes a link to the pull request and a revision-stable link to the deliverable.\n\nBack-burner issues\nWe will sometimes acknowledge issues that must be addressed before completion of a project but are not of high enough priority that they will be worked on within a month. To make sure such issues are not forgotten, each project will have a single GitHub issue named \"Back-burner issues list\" that lists all such issues. This approach avoids clogging up the list of GitHub issues with tasks we will not address for some time.\nWhen the time comes to address a back-burner issue, the assignee will create a new, proper GitHub issue that adheres to the standards above and remove the corresponding entry from the back-burner issues list. All back-burner issues must be addressed before completion of a project.\n"},"pages/GitHub-Commits.html":{"url":"pages/GitHub-Commits.html","title":"GitHub Commits","keywords":"","body":"GitHub Commits\nYou should have \"atomic commits\" on GitHub - that is, a commit should hang together around a single goal or topic. If you have made changes with different purposes since your last commit, it is good practice to add the changes in several logical batches.\nEach commit should be made with a message that begins with a reference to the relevant issue(s) and ends with a brief summary of what the commit accomplishes. We reference issues using the syntax #123 to create a link to issue #123. A commit command could be\ngit commit -m \"#123 Change something\" (or equivalent in Github desktop)\nA good commit message is concise and descriptive. Ideally, the message is a single line of text that explains what you did and why you did it. Below are some examples of good and bad commit messages\n\n\"#123 Modify code.R to add number of observations to main regression table\" [Good]\n\"#123 Modifying code.R\" [Bad, redundant with what git is recording]\n\nCommits should almost always be made in a branch that corresponds to a GitHub issue rather than in the master branch.

Alternatively, you may consider automated software such as ManicTime. This reporting is in addition to whatever official time tracking system you may have through the university.\nWeekly Notes\nAt the beginning of the project, we should create a GitHub Issue titled \"Weekly Notes.\" Once per week, RA's who are working regularly on the project should post to the Weekly Notes issue, @mentioning all project members, so that we all get notified of the update. Each week's post should contain the following in bullet form:\n\nIssues search. A link to a GitHub Issues search for all open issues that are assigned to you and have not been updated in the past two weeks. The search can be formatted as in this link.\nLast week's tasks. Brief list of what you worked on in the preceding week and summary of key insights/developments,  referencing output files and Issues if helpful. \nSchedule. If we have a schedule, how does progress compare to scheduled progress?\nLask week's hours. A count of hours spent on the project in the past week.\nDiscussion. (Optional) Any additional information to discuss.\nAssignments to others. If needed, reminders to others of Issues/tasks that they need to complete, including required completion dates, e.g., @eherrnst additional data X ASAP, @erikylelewis code review Y by 3/25, @kelloggrk you must resolve Issue #42 by 4/3.\nNext week's tasks. Proposed list of tasks for the next week.\n\nNote that the Issues threads remain the only task management/discussion threads. The Weekly Note is not a duplicate or substitute; it is instead intended to be a regular reminder to address unfinished tasks and a mechanism by which project management principles are enforced.\nMeetings\nAt least 24 hours in advance of a group meeting, the lead RA should prepare a meeting notes post on Slack that is populated with an agenda and, if efficient, links to any files/results that will be discussed in the meeting. Following the meeting, the RA is in charge of: (1) adding a summary of meeting outcomes and decisions onto the meeting notes post on Slack; and (2) creating and assigning issues as necessary on Github.\n"},"pages/Coding-Principles.html":{"url":"pages/Coding-Principles.html","title":"Coding Principles","keywords":"","body":"Coding Principles\nWe generally want to follow the Gentzkow and Shapiro code structure and data storage protocols. Also see chapters 6 and 7 of the old Gentzkow and Shapiro guide that cover abstraction and self-documentation. Several basic things to re-emphasize:\n\nThe entire project, from initial data to compiling the paper pdf, can be run from one command, typically GitHub/ProjectName/MakePaper.sh. This shell script will call other files, e.g. Stata, R, Matlab, and Python.\nDo not manually pre-process data, e.g. manipulate Excel sheets, before importing into R or Stata. All data processing, beginning with the original file, should be automated and called from MakePaper.sh.\nTo keep MakePaper.sh from getting too long and unwieldy, MakePaper.sh may instead call sub-batch files that group together calls to functionally-related Stata, R, etc. code (e.g., BuildPriceData.sh, BuildDrillingData.sh, Estimation.sh, etc.)\n\n\nKeep code less than 100 characters wide so that it is easy to read.\nEach dataset has a valid (unique, non-missing) key. For example, you might have dataset of US county characteristics, e.g. square miles and 1969 population, with one row for each county, and the key being the stateFIPS+countyFIPS.\nKeep datasets normalized (meaning that they contain only variables at the same logical level as the key) as late in the data preparation process as possible. Once you merge a state-level dataset with a county-level dataset, the state-level variables are recorded many times (one for each county). This takes a lot of space and can also confuse other aspects of data preparation.\nCode should be system agnostic, in that once user-specific directories are identified at the top of the code, along with a query for the identity of the user, the code can be run from any team member's machine without having to manually change the program's working directory.\nFile paths should always use forward slashes (/) rather than backslashes (\\) to avoid problems on non-Windows OS's.\nBest practice is to include a short piece of code in the /Code directory that can other routines can call to obtain directory paths. In Stata, this can be accomplished through the use of the include command. Thus, each routine need only point to each user's /Code directory rather than the full set of sub-directories. This approach avoids the need to modify every routine should we decide to re-organize the directory structure at a later date.\n\n\nCode should also be version agnostic, so that team members (and future reproducers) get the same results no matter what version of software they are using. In Stata, this can be accomplished by using the version command to set the Stata version to the lowest version in use by the team.\nWhenever using an algorithm that requires random number generation (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation or bootstrapping), set the seed so that the results do not change every time the code is run.\nAs much as possible we would like to use object-oriented programming (OOP). It adds a layer of structure and simplification to large, complicated code. A nice introduction to OOP for Economics can be found here. \n\n"},"pages/R-Guide.html":{"url":"pages/R-Guide.html","title":"R Guide","keywords":"","body":"R Guide\nWe follow the general guidelines in Hadley Wickham's Style Guide. We also try not to use base R if there is a Wickham alternative. About 99% of what we do can be found in one of these packages:\n\ndplyr or data.table for data manipulation.\nlubridate for dealing with dates/\nreadr and readxl for reading in rectangular data. \ntibble is a modern re-imagining of data.frames; it provides stricter checking and better formatting than the traditional data frame.\nstringr for character manipulation and string detection. \ntidyr makes it easier to tidy up data. The main two functions here are \ngather(), which converts wide data to longer format, and \nspread(), which converts long data to wider format. \n\n\nsf for spatial data manipulation\nggplot2 for plotting and mapping\npurrr is the functional programming toolkit for R. The main functions here are \nmap() family which replace the apply family from base R and \nreduce which replaces the Reduce function from base R that iteratively applies a function to a list. \n\n\n\nOnce you have written your code in an .R or .txt file, use source() in R to read the file and execute the commands in the file.\nPiping\nWe want to use the piping style as much as can because it organizes code in a very readable fashion. Pipes take the output from one function and feed it to the first argument of the next function. In R, you pipe using the %>% symbol. A simple example for finding the maximum of a vector (instead of of max(c(1, 2, 3))) is \nc(1, 2, 3) %>% max\nThe cool part of piping with dplyr is creating piping chains, which basically allows us to order the data manipulation steps in an easily understandable fashion and avoid creating temporary variables in between steps. The example data frame below are weights for different animals, and the piping example will show how we would find the species with the greatest mean weight.\ndf %\n  group_by(Animal) %>%\n  summarise(MeanWeight = mean(Weight)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(MeanWeight))\nWithout piping, the operation would look like \narrange(summarise(group_by(df, Animal), MeanWeight = mean(Weight)))\nFor further ease of reading, we want to have one function per line when piping. Bad piping style would look like \ndf %>% group_by(Animal) %>%  summarise(MeanWeight = mean(Weight)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(MeanWeight))\nrather than what we have above. \nUsing data.table\nGenerally, dplyr is good for 90% of what we need to do, but it has a tendency to use RAM inefficiently. When this constraint becomes binding, it's time to switch over to data.table.\nAlmost everything you can do in dplyr can also be done in data.table but it is generally less elegant. Let's keep working with the example animal data-frame we had before. First we will convert it to a data.table:\ndf The general format of a data table command is\ntable[rows to act on, columns to update/keep, grouping]\nso to summarize the average weight of each animal, we would write\ndf[,.(MeanWeight = mean(Weight)), by = Animal]\nIf we didn't want to lose that height data, we would instead write\ndf[,`:=`(MeanWeight = mean(Weight)), by = Animal]\nSimilar to piping in dplyr, there is chaining in data.table. Let's say after computing the average weight by animal, we want to compute the average height by family of animals, then we would chain these operations as follows: \ndf[,`:=`(MeanWeight = mean(Weight)), by = Animal][\n   ,`:=`(MeanHeight = mean(Height)), by = Family]\nOne more trick that is very useful is .SD. This allows you to manipulate each group of data. Let's say we wanted for each animal the height of the heaviest animal of that type. One approach to doing this is\ndf[, `:=`(BiggestWeight = max(Weight)), by = Animal][\n   Weight == BiggestWeight, .(GoodHeight = Height, Animal)]\nBut what if we wanted this GoodHeight column to be added to our original table, this would require us to use a .SD:\ndf[, GoodHeight := .SD[, .(BiggestWeight = max(Weight),\n                           Weight,\n                           Height)][\n                       Weight == BiggestWeight, Height]\n   , by = Animal]\nA comprehensive guide to data.table is linked below.\nStyle Highlights\n\nIn order to make file paths system agnostic, we use the function file.path() to point to directories. \nKeep code to 80 characters per line. You can add an 80 character margin in your source pane by going to Tools > Code > Display > Show Margin\nUse \nMake sure all datasets are stored as a tibble\nadd carriage return for code that is longer than one line \n\ncheck %\n  as_tibble\nrather than\ncheck %\n  as_tibble\nLearning Materials\n\nRStudio setup and tutorial\nThe entire foundations section of Hadley's Advanced R book\ndplyr tutorial\nProgramming in R tutorial\nSpatial data manipulation with sf\nExtensive data.table guide\nRegular expression in R tutorial\n\nRandom\nRunning bash job on server\n\nIn the first line of R program write #!/usr/bin/Rscript\nAfter finalizing your batch script, type into the command line chmod +x rprogram.R followed by Rscript rprogram.R --verbose\n\n"},"pages/Production-Tasks.html":{"url":"pages/Production-Tasks.html","title":"Production Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Production Tasks\nBefore we submit, finalize, or publicly post a new draft of a paper, the following tasks should be done.

The best candidates can supplement these letters with concrete independent research, from an undergraduate thesis or other independent project.\nDuring your time as an RA you can improve how PhD programs will evaluate you on both of these dimensions. It is my job to design the work you do as an RA to ensure that, in addition to getting my own work done, I also put myself in a good position to evaluate your research skills in my letter.\nThe rest is largely up to you. However, I can contribute to the other aspects of your application by advising you on courses, providing feedback on application materials, and giving you guidance on independent research. In addition, my letter will allow me to make credible statements about “softer” elements of your application, such as the quality of independent research you have done.\nQuarterly review\nAt the end of each academic quarter, we will have a meeting to discuss:\n\nRA work.\nClasses.\nYour research.\nOther decisions/issues related to your application.\nYou are responsible for scheduling this meeting. Please e-mail me by week 9 of the quarter to schedule the meeting. When you e-mail, please include the following information in your e-mail:\nGrades from any courses you have taken at Chicago or other institutions in previous quarters.\nA list of courses taken in the current quarter with whatever information you have on grade outcomes (exam grades, problem set grades, etc.)\nA brief summary of the main areas of RA work you have been involved in over the past quarter.\nAn outline of any other issues you wish to discuss regarding your progress.\n\nNote that these meetings are meant to guarantee a minimum to the frequency of our interactions on the topics listed above, not a maximum. I am always happy to discuss aspects of your progress.\nAfter the meeting, please email to me a brief summary of what we discussed. I will write back and confirm or amend your understanding as needed. This way, we can be sure to stay on the same page.\nPreparing your application\nBelow is a list of the elements of your application that it will be useful for me to know about. Adhering to the deadlines below will allow me to write the strongest possible letter for you and to give you informed and timely advice on other aspects of your application. Ultimately, of course, it is your application, and (with the exception of deadlines for recommendation letters) you are free to ignore these suggestions.\n\nIntermediate Summary. By September 15 of the year in which you are applying, please send me the following information so that I can provide feedback:\n\nA spreadsheet listing the top 50 economics PhD programs along with an indication of whether you plan to apply to each program and any notes you have on the reasons for your decision. You can use the US News and World Report list as a starting point. Depending on your interests, you may also want to include top programs in agricultural / resource / environmental economics, top public policy programs, and top business schools offering PhD programs.\nA draft of your personal/research statement.\n\n\nFinal Summary. By September 30 of the year in which you are applying, please send me the following information:\n\nA list of the programs to which you are applying, along with the deadlines for recommendation letters for each program.\nA list of people writing letters for you.\nFinal transcripts from undergraduate and any other courses you have taken.\nA draft of your personal statement and any other essay materials you will be submitting with your applications.\nA draft of your CV.\nA list of what you see as your most impressive accomplishments in your RA work.\nA list of the main things you think you’ve learned / main ways in which you’ve improved in your RA work.\nWhen you send me these materials, you should also schedule a meeting so that we can have a final conversation about your application.\n\n\nOngoing. After September 30 please keep me posted in real time on:\nAny exam or course grades for courses in which you are enrolled in the fall quarter of the year in which you are applying.\nAny other new information that you think might be relevant for my letter.\nAny program decisions (acceptances/rejections) that you receive.\n\n\n\n"}}}
